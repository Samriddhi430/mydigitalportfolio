                    <h2>Why I Chose C++ for DSA</h2>
                    <p>C++ is renowned for its performance and efficiency, making it an ideal language for implementing complex algorithms and data structures. Its rich standard library, including the STL (Standard Template Library), provides a powerful set of tools for effective problem-solving. Additionally, understanding memory management in C++ has deepened my grasp of how data structures operate under the hood.</p>
