                <p>In recent times, Deep Learning (DL) has made remarkable progress in addressing complex real-world challenges. The success of DL can be attributed to factors such as the architecture design, optimization methods utilized, and the careful adjustment of hyperparameters to uncover meaningful patterns in data. In this study, our aim is to enhance the performance of a deep learning algorithm by exploring an optimization method. The main concerns in learning algorithms are the issues related to getting stuck in local minima and slow convergence. To tackle these challenges, we employ the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), a popular nature-inspired optimization method commonly used in engineering and scientific domains. In this study, we introduce a modified version of WOA called Chaotic Oppositional-based Whale Optimization Algorithm (COWOA), which combines chaotic oppositional theory.</p><br>
                <p>To address the limitation of WOA, we incorporate a chaotic function in COWOA. Specifically, we utilize the Gaussian chaotic map, which has shown superior performance compared to other chaotic maps. This is attributed to the Gaussian map's broader range of values and a relatively flatter distribution, allowing it to effectively explore the search space and avoid being trapped in local minima. Additionally, the Gaussian map possesses excellent ergodicity and mixing properties, enabling it to cover the search space thoroughly and uniformly. By incorporating the Gaussian chaotic map into COWOA, we enhance its capability to discover global optima and optimize overall performance.</p>
